Hello! I’m Soumyodeep Dey, a passionate explorer of the universe, both in the grand cosmic sense and the diverse cultures of our beautiful planet. My journey through life is driven by a triad of passions: physics, travel, and photography. My intend to make this blog is to write my everyday experience through the space-time of this universe.

### Physics Enthusiast
Ever since I can remember, I've been fascinated by the fundamental principles that govern our universe. This curiosity led me to pursue studies in physics, where I've delved into everything from quantum mechanics to cosmology. Whether it’s pondering the mysteries of dark matter or marveling at the elegance of relativity, I find immense joy in uncovering the secrets of the cosmos. My academic and personal endeavors are constantly fueled by the awe-inspiring complexity and beauty of the physical world. I am currently working as a researcher at the University of Birmingham, UK in the field of Cold Atom physics to explore fundamental Physics.

### Avid Traveler
Traveling is my way of connecting with the world and experiencing the rich tapestry of human culture. I've been fortunate to explore many countries, each offering unique insights and unforgettable experiences. I have explored many places in the United Kingdom as I am staying here. I have also explored Paris, Würzburg, Heidelberg, Prague and few more places. I am egar to explore many more cuntries in the upcoming times. Every new destination is an opportunity to learn, grow, and be inspired.

### Photography Lover
Photography is my creative outlet and a perfect complement to my love for travel. Through my lens, I strive to capture the essence of the places I visit and the stories they tell. Whether it's a stunning landscape, a candid street scene, or the intricate details of everyday life, photography allows me to document and share my adventures with the world. My work is a blend of artistic expression and documentary storytelling, aiming to evoke emotion and spark curiosity.
